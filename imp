Amazon EBS provides block level storage - It is used to create a filesystem on it and store files.
Amazon EFS - its shared storage system similar like NAS/SAN. You need to mount it to unix server and use it.
Amazon S3 - It is object based storage where each item is stored with a http URL.

One of the difference is - EBS can be attached to 1 instance at a time and EFS can be attached to multiple instances that why shared storage. S3 
plain object storage cannot be mounted.

Glacier is:

Long term archive storage
Extremely cheap to store
Potentially very expensive to retrieve
Takes up to 4 hours to "read back" your data (so only store items you know you won't need to retrieve for a long time)
