Simply we say

where we can launch aws resources in a virtual network and we can control over the network 
vpc lets you provision a logically isolated network 
in vpc we can control our virtual networking env ip address creation of subnets route tables and gateways

instead of 

Modem - internetgateway
Router and switches- Routing tables
Firwall - Netwrok access control list(NACL),SECURITY GROUPS
system - ec2

we create whatever resources we require and create our own virtual private network and can control access to the network

We have default VPC in cloud
default vpc have internet conncetivity
we public and private vpc
5 vpc per region


DNS SERVER
ROOT DNS
SLD DNS
TLD DNS
CIDR


=========================

we can create 5 vpc per region.

maximun 16 and min 28 for cidr range

need for subnet==>

iam running an application and database

so i need public subnet and private subnets

5 addeess ipv6 aws keeps in reserved 

10.0.0.0,1,2,3,
n/w addeess,vpc routers,aws DNS, futre use 
last ip address broadcast address

in nacl we allow and deny ports
in security we can't deny port and we can only allow

nacl operates on subnet level
security groubs instance level
