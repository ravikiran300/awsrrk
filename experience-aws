in nacl we allow ports and deny ports
nacl operates on subnet level

in security groubs instance level
in security we can't deny port and we can only allow

How to create a high-availability web site with an Application Load Balancer using Autoscaling and monitored by Cloudwatch

Objectives:
A Custom VPC with 3 Availability Zones for High Availability
Each Availability Zone has a public subnet ONLY.
There are two EC2 instances, created by a launch template which will have specifications to include custom VPCs in public subnets.
Next, we are going to add a bootstrap script to automatically install and setup the Apache Web Server in Advanced Details under User data.
This will enable to check IP addresses located in different Availability zones on the Apache test page..
Configure / Setup an auto-scaling group for the instances with an instance minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5. The scaling policy will use CloudWatch to scale after the CPU Utilization is above 80%
Create one Target Group and register both the EC2 instances.
Configure An Elastic Application Load Balancer which automatically distributes your network workload across multiple targets. 
Those targets can be an EC2 instance, S3 bucket or an IP address in multiple availability zones.
A stress tool will be used to stress an instance above 80% CPU Utilization to make sure the above scaling policy works.
